The janitor juggles services

---

The janitor enables a pleasant workflow for managing multiple containerized services on a single machine.

The janitor watches a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository full of [Compose](https://compose-spec.io/) files.

The janitor automatically generates systemd unit wrappers and provides lifecycle hooks.
